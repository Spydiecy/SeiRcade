## Play-to-Earn Gaming Platform on monad chain

MonCade is a skill-based competitive gaming platform built on the monad chain where players can earn real rewards through mini-games. Inspired by platforms like MPL and Winzo, our platform enables users to compete in simple yet engaging games with entry fees, creating prize pools where winners earn real value in the form of monad tokens.

## 🎮 Project Overview

MonCade serves as a trustless intermediary, leveraging monad chain for transparent and secure prize distribution. Players convert monad tokens into platform points, which they use to enter competitive game rooms. After competing in skill-based mini-games, winners receive prize pools (minus a small platform commission).
