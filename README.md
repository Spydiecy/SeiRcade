## Play-to-Earn Gaming Platform on Sei Chain

SeiRcade is a skill-based competitive gaming platform built on the Sei Chain where players can earn real rewards through mini-games. Inspired by platforms like MPL and Winzo, our platform enables users to compete in simple yet engaging games with entry fees, creating prize pools where winners earn real value in the form of SEI tokens.

## 🎮 Project Overview

SeiRcade serves as a trustless intermediary, leveraging Sei Chain for transparent and secure prize distribution. Players convert SEI tokens into platform points, which they use to enter competitive game rooms. After competing in skill-based mini-games, winners receive prize pools (minus a small platform commission).
